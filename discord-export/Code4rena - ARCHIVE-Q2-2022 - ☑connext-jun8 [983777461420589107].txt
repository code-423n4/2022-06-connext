@layne | MST Don't mention it. They should put it back. 😉

anyone else having trouble building the project?


[06/09/2022 5:05 PM] luksgrin
```yarn``` ends up crashing


[06/09/2022 7:39 PM] layne7534
should be fixed!

hey @layne | MST ! I have a quick question, can I dm?


[06/09/2022 9:59 PM] layne7534
Yep!

it's failing because of a missing file tsconfig.base.json, was able to find it here https://github.com/connext/nxtp/blob/main/config/tsconfig.base.json Create a tsconfig.base.json file in the root folder and copy the content in the link into it and the yarn build will run successfully

You can also get the majority of tests running using foundry/forge after installing forge-std/ds-test/oz-upgradeable.

Yes, I guess I must be 🙂 Thanks!


[06/14/2022 10:57 AM] abhinavmir#1898
Needed a quick help. This error - `Message:  checksum not available: "0.8.14"` - any resolutions for this? I'm using solidity 0.8.14.


[06/14/2022 4:33 PM] layne7534
yes!


[06/14/2022 9:27 PM] cryptphi
what action did you perform for the thrown error? there's not much context to the help you're requesting


[06/14/2022 9:28 PM] abhinavmir#1898
think it was `yarn test:forge` - edit: yes it was this command


[06/14/2022 9:30 PM] cryptphi
ah, i didn't run test...maybe someone that's run that can help you out..... however 2 things might occur...either the ethereum address is wrong (maybe missing a character or an additional character was inputed), or the solc-bin checksum doesn't match


[06/14/2022 9:31 PM] cryptphi
so if you assume nothing wrong with the solc file on your machine, then confirm the eth address in the test is valid


[06/14/2022 9:31 PM] cryptphi
sorry can't help much since i didn't run the forge rest at my end....


[06/14/2022 9:32 PM] abhinavmir#1898
haven't used forge much either. Where can I have a look at the eth address?


[06/14/2022 9:43 PM] cryptphi
maybe @layne | MST can help look into this for you


[06/14/2022 9:43 PM] abhinavmir#1898
thanks, that'll be dope!


[06/14/2022 10:12 PM] layne7534
Like deployed testnet addresses? Which networks? We have a few and I can give you some links and a breakdown in a second


[06/14/2022 10:40 PM] layne7534
all deployed contracts are here: https://github.com/connext/nxtp/blob/main/packages/deployments/contracts/deployments.json

[06/15/2022 12:07 AM] abhinavmir#1898
Thanks Layne – to give context, I was referring to this error `Message:  checksum not available: "0.8.14"` upon running `yarn test:forge` - to which cryptphi suggested it could be because the Ethereum address is wrong. I was wondering what address are they referring to?


[06/15/2022 12:08 AM] abhinavmir#1898
This seems to be a general Forge issue, but couldn't find a reliable answer to this online. Haven't used Foundry much, thus was hoping someone here could help me 🌴


[06/15/2022 1:12 AM] pierrickgt
Are you running the latest version of forge?


[06/15/2022 3:18 AM] cloudjunky
Has anyone been successful getting slither to work on this repo? all I get are python traceback errors.


[06/15/2022 3:19 AM] cloudjunky
Related to ternary support https://github.com/crytic/slither/issues/775


[06/15/2022 8:51 AM] abhinavmir#1898
I uninstalled and reinstalled everything and it seems to work now. But yes, updating `forge` should've been enough. But now I'm running into another error which I guess is due to how `remappings.txt` is written.

```solidity
 0: Failed to resolve file: "/Users/.../connext/contracts/lib/forge-std/src/console.sol": No such file or directory (os error 2).
       Check configured remappings.
```


[06/15/2022 10:50 AM] cloudjunky
Try `forge install foundry-rs/forge-std --no-commit`


[06/15/2022 10:56 AM] 0x4non
same here... im gettin this error
```Error: 
   0: Failed to resolve file: "/home/....../code4rena/2022-06-connext/contracts/lib/ds-test/src/test.sol": No such file or directory (os error 2).
       Check configured remappings.
```


[06/15/2022 11:03 AM] cloudjunky
Now```
forge install dapphub/ds-test --no-commit
forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable --no-commit
```


[06/15/2022 11:03 AM] cloudjunky
You shouldn't need to touch the remappings.txt file.


[06/15/2022 11:07 AM] 0x4non
that work! however i think i need to touch the remmapings, im getting errors on loading "@openzeppelin" libs


[06/15/2022 11:09 AM] cloudjunky
`forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit`


[06/15/2022 3:58 PM] cryptphi
sometimes you have to run the command from the right location, confirm which directory/folder you are running the command from

Hey there just an FYI, internal library functions are inlined (well, added as internal functions afaik) in the calling contract, so it doesn't actually save code size


[06/17/2022 5:41 AM] zer0dot
external functions are however called via delegatecall

Hi there, 
need help while debuging connext test on foundry 
I am getting external imports on running debug 


```
// ============ External Imports ============
import {Home} from "../../nomad-core/contracts/Home.sol";
import {XAppConnectionManager} from "../../nomad-core/contracts/XAppConnectionM`[...]', library/core/src/str/mod.rs:107:9
Aborted (core dumped)

```
But nomad core is also installed .... 
Is anybody facing the same issue?

would it be possible to communicate with an admin or the judge to check the status of several submissions of mine? i see only a qa level finding but had submitted several other vulnerabilities, albeit all of them in the same file... looks like maybe it was taken out of scope (or severity was wrong for *all* my submissions..)
